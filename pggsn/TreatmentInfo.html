        <b>Now starts Part 2 of the experiment.</b> Please remember that you will be either paid for Part 1 or Part 2 of the experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Part 2 you will make the same decisions as in Part 1, again over 10 rounds. All the payoff rules stay the same. However, participants are randomly regrouped for the next 10 rounds. You will therefore interact in the next 10 rounds with three new participants you haven’t interacted with before. You will remain in this new group for all 10 rounds.

                Typically, participants contribute between 10% and 40% in those kinds of games. Thus, participants contribute little to the public account.

                Typically, participants start to contribute 40% and end with contributing 10% in those kinds of games. Thus, participants contribute less and less to the public account.
