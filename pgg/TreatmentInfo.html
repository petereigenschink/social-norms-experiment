    <p>
        Now we enter the second half of the experiment with another 10 rounds. Please remember, you will be paid the money you earned from either the first 10 rounds or the following 10 rounds. Therefore, your decisions in the first part should not affect your decisions in the second part.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note: participants are regrouped for the next 10 rounds. Therefore, in the next 10 rounds you will interact with three new participants you haven’t interacted with before. You will remain in this new group for all following 10 rounds. The general logic of the game remains the same.

                Typically, people contribute between 10% and 40% in those kinds of games. Thus, participants contribute little to the public account.

                Typically, people start to contribute 40% and end with contributing 10% in those kinds of games. Thus, participants contribute less and less to the public account.
