    <p>
        Very well done! You played 10 periods and earned <b>{{ participant.payoff }}</b> (= {{ participant.payoff_in_real_world_currency() }}). Now we enter the second half of the experiment with another 10 periods to play. Please remember, you will be paid the money you earned from either the first 10 periods or the following 10 periods. Therefore, your decisions in the first part should not affect your decisions in the second part.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note: participants are regrouped for the next 10 periods. You will therefore play the next 10 periods with three new participants you haven’t played with before. You will remain in this new group for all following 10 periods. The general logic of the game remains the same.

                Typically, people contribute between 10% and 40% in those kinds of games. Thus, participants contribute little to the public account.

                Typically, people start to contribute 40% and end with contributing 10% in those kinds of games. Thus, participants contribute less and less to the public account.
