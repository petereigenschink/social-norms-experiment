    <p>
        Very well done! You played 10 periods and earned <b>{{ participant.payoff }}</b> (= {{ participant.payoff_in_real_world_currency() }}). Now we enter the second half of the experiment with another 10 periods to play. Please remember, you will be paid the money you earned from either the first 10 periods or the following 10 periods.

        Please note: We decided to regroup participants for the next 10 periods. You will therefore play the next 10 periods with three new participants you haven’t played with before. You will remain in this new group for all following 10 periods. The general logic of decision making remains the same. We only changed the screen at the beginning of each period (which will now look like this):
